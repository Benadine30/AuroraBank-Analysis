# AuroraBank-Analysis
**OVERVIEW:**

This project is an end-to-end SQL analytics case study for Aurora Bank, designed to uncover insights from customer, transaction, credit card data, and behaviors to unlock new opportunities for growth and engagement. As a data analyst, my goal was to analyze customer demographics, financial health, card usage, and transaction behaviors to provide data-driven recommendations that can improve customer engagement, identify potential risks, and strengthen fraud detection.

The analysis was performed using Microsoft SQL Server, and insights were later visualized in Power BI for executive reporting.
